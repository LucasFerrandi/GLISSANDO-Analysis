#Study of Hot Spots Produced in Initial Stages of Relativistic Heavy-Ions Collisions
Work done during my scientific initiation at IFUSP

HotSpotsAnalysis.C takes the ".points" files generated by GLISSANDO3 and produces histograms
of the energy densities that may or may not be saved, either as .png or .root. 
It then calculates the quantities:
  epsfixfireball,
  epspartfireball,
  mediaepsfix,
  desvpadmed_epsfix,
  mediaepspart,
  desvpadmed_epspart,
  mediaenergia,
  desvpadmed_energia,
  mediaphrot e
  desvpadmed_phrot
for each r2_hs, b, and SEED, and saves them in a .txt file.
When used together with ProduzResults.sh, this program also saves these quantities 
for different r2_hs, b, and SEED and stores them in another .txt file.
FinalAnalysisHotSpots.py Generates the final plots.
